Hello!

Welcome to my Stress Meter Application.

In this assignment I have implemented a program that queries the user multiple times using a set of images that correlate with a perceived stress level. The app records the stress meter scores and time stamps in a .CSV file that is visualized through a graph.

The app comprises 4 views: the image request, image response, visualization and NavigationView. 

To run the application, simply load the Boris_Perdija_Stress_Meter.apk into an android device and run!
